I had a lot of doubt and uncertainty about myself I felt like everything was slipping out of my hands; but you were there to hold my hand and tell me everything is going to be okay. You constantly reminded me what I was capable of, you literally changed my life because for the first time ever I stopped living in fear and I got so far thanks to you. I feel so priviledged to have someone as caring and patient as you. Thank you for always believing in me💖 </div>

                <div class="panel-header">This was one of the longest months ever. It pained me to see you everyday but to know that I couldn't really hang with you and talk to you like we normally would. There were countless instances where I felt like giving up on everything; but the thought of being with you for the following days kept me going. You've literally given me so much drive to keep pushing because I feel like you deserve to see the best version of me. You mean everything to me babe💖 I also still can't stop thinking about the first time we made out, it was sooo perfect and I wish I could make that moment last forever 💖</div>
